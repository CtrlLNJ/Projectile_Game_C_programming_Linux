# Projectile_Game_C_programming_Linux
C programming assignment of my first year, which is a C final project before 2017 run in Linux based on library written by University of York. It is a game that is mainly about a stick man throws a coin following a projectile trace.
It only can be run in Linux system because the library only supports this system, which is quite limited.
Report fully explains the principle, which is more meaningful than the program now.
